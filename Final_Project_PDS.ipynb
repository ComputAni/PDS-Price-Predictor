    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand Uber's pricing model, we need to identify patterns in trips that have already been made. Unfortunately, Uber does not make past trips publicly available, so we focused on data from an equally popular transportation service: Yellow Taxi, NYC, as a plethora of historical trip data was available. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's our pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Get original data: Use Socrata API to scrape Yellow Taxi Trip Data. Collect the most recent trip information available (Jan - June 2016, roughly 1 million entries).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Clean data: Discard any invalid entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Feature engineering: Using just the starting location, ending location, and trip duration, come up with a set of features that could influence transportation pricing schemes. Perform analysis on the data to get a better idea of features. \n",
    "\n",
    "4) Model creation: Split original dataset into train/test sets. Use Cross-Validation and Mean-Squared Error (MSE) to assess performance of different models. Pick best-performing model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Comparison: Using Uber API, make sample requests to get pricing information of trips. Generate features for these trips and get a Model pricing estimate. Compare using MSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the best-performing model can indicate a similarity between Yellow Cab and Uber pricing models. While we are aware that Uber has many \"hidden\" features that may contribute to their pricing (this is a good assumption, or else what exactly differentiates Uber!), we hope to uncover some of the more significant features that may contribute to fare price."

    "One advantage of a linear model is its interpretability: A coefficient of 0.244 on distance suggests that an increase of one mile to the trip causes its price to increase by \\$0.244 (holding all other variables constant). We can interpret features with low weights, such as `tpep_pickup_datetime_years`, as having little influence on the predicted price. This makes sense, since the years feature is actually constant for all trips!"

This method reduces high-dimensional data to fewer dimensions, making it easier to analyze and train models on.\n",

   "source": [
    "We can expand upon our work to improve the results and our findings in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1) Use Supply and Demand to determine price**: Uber is known to factor this into their calculation of surge pricing. We couldn't really take this into account due to the lack of data regarding the number of requests from/to a certain location and number of cars available on road. More info about surge pricing at: https://www.uber.com/drive/partner-app/how-surge-works/\n",
    "\n",
    "**2) Use more features like WalkScore, TransitScore**: It would be great to add features that explain the livability of an area - i.e. how good is the public transit in an area, is it walkable? This would help us find the real need of Uber in certain areas and how that correlates with prices. We actually had this feature working, however, we couldn't get it to work on a million data points as we had to convert lat/long coordinates to addresses. Geopy, the conversion API, only allowed 2500 data points for 24 hours. More info about WalkScore's API at: https://www.walkscore.com/professional/api.php\n",
    "\n",
    "**3) Model using Neural Nets**: We could use more models to train our data like Neural Networks, in an attempt to reduce our test set error. Since, we have a million data points, we actually have enough data to train a neural network! More information to train a neural network using scikit-learn can be found at: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neural_networks_supervised.html. We can also use Tensorflow for this purpose: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/ \n",
    "\n",
    "**4) Extending scope to different regions, prices and times**: We can also extend the scope of the project to test in different cities and compare prices between cities of similar sizes. As noted above, our model does not perform well on high prices and services with higher prices such as UberBlack. We would like to incorporate these into our models. Lastly, while we used data between Jan-June 2016 for training, it would be great to incorporate a greater spread of time information. We could even create a time-series of all data and understand how the models have changed over time."
