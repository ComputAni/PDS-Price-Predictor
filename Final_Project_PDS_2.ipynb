    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand the pricing model of Uber and other taxi companies, we need to identify patterns in trips that have already been made. Unfortunately, Uber does not make past trips (in general, not for one specific user) publicly available, so we focused on data from an equally popular transportation service: Yellow Taxi. In particular, we focused on the greater New York area, as a plethora of historical trip data was available (described below). \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we needed a metric to quantify the performance of this relevant data. Specifically, we found the Uber API to give us real-time pricing information about trips. We collected this data through the API, and made relevant comparisons between Uber's and our Model's pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our pipeline is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Get original Yellow Taxi data: Use Socrata API to scrape dataset from Yellow Taxi Trip Data. Collect the most recent trip information available (Jan - June 2016, roughly 1 million entries).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Clean data: Clean up the entries in this dataset. Discard any invalid entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Feature engineering: Using just the starting location, ending location, trip dropoff, and trip pickup times, come up with a set of features that can potentially influence transportation pricing schemes. Perform analysis on the data to learn more about the features. \n",
    "\n",
    "4) Model creation: Split original dataset into train + test sets. Use cross-validation and mean squared error to assess performance of different models (i.e linear regression). Pick best performing model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Comparison: Using Uber API, make sample requests to get pricing information of trips. Generate features for these trips and get a Model pricing estimate as well. Compare them using MSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, you can see that a good performing model (one metric being a lower MSE) can indicate that the features we chose are appropriate in describing a similarity between Yellow Cab and Uber pricing models. While we are aware that Uber has many \"hidden\" features that may contribute to their pricing (this is a good assumption, or else what exactly differentiates Uber!), we hope to uncover some of the more significant features that may contribute to fare price."

    "One of the advantages of a simple linear model is its interpretability: A coefficient of 0.244 on distance suggests that an increase of one mile to the trip causes the price of the trip goes up by \\$0.244 (holding all other variables constant). We can interpret features with really low weights, such as `tpep_pickup_datetime_years`, as having little influence on the predicted price. This makes sense, since the years feature is actually constant for all trips! Another interesting observation is the coefficient of 0.151 on is_holiday. This means that, all things equal, the price of a trip is $0.15 more on holidays!"

    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a common way to speed up machine learning algorithms. PCA's [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) describes that PCA tends to convert possibly correlated variables into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables. PCA is used to reduce data of high dimensionality to fewer dimensions, making it easier to analyze and train models.\n",

    "We use Scikit-learn's PCA class, that takes in the number of components and allows us to transform our data to the resulting number of dimensions. More information at: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html"

This result is actually quite good because it illustrates only a $1.12 discrepency between the two pricing schemes. We didn't expect the performance to be identical, however, because we are using yellow cab data, and there most definitely are hidden factors that contribute to Uber's pricing model. \n",

    "If you look more closely at the pricing differences for each trip, you'll notice that our model struggles with higher-priced Ubers; specifically, our model tends to lowball pricing for high-priced Ubers. Upon closer inspection, we found some of the higher-priced trips to actually be relatively short in trip distance, indicating that Uber's surge pricing algorithm might have been used. We'll discuss this in future scope, but surge pricing could explain the discrepency between model pricing and Uber pricing. With this in mind, we aimed to provide a model that fit smaller, more consistent trips, so in our original dataset, we only trained on trips less than a threshold Yellow-cab fare price. \n",

    "Ultimately, there are hidden features and factors that Uber uses in determining its pricing algorithm. We found our model to perform quite well (relative to Uber's ground truth).

    "We can expand upon our work to improve the results and our findings in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1) Use Supply and Demand to determine price**: Uber is known to factor this into their calculation of surge pricing. We couldn't really take this into account due to the lack of data regarding the number of requests from/to a certain location and number of cars available on road. More information about how surge pricing works can be found here: https://www.uber.com/drive/partner-app/how-surge-works/\n",
    "\n",
    "**2) Use more features like WalkScore, TransitScore**: It would be great to add features that explain the livability of an area - i.e. how good is the public transit in an area, is it walkable? This would help us find the real need of Uber in certain areas and how that correlates with prices. We actually had this feature working, however, we couldn't get it to work on a million data points as we had to convert lat/long coordinates to addresses. However, geopy - the conversion API only allowed 2500 data points for 24 hours. More info about the API can be found on: https://www.walkscore.com/professional/api.php\n",
    "\n",
    "**3) Model using Neural Nets**: We could use more models to train our data like Neural Networks, in an attempt to reduce our test set error. Since, we have a million data points, we actually have enough data to train a neural network! More information to train a neural network using scikit-learn can be found at: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neural_networks_supervised.html. We can also use Tensorflow for this purpose: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/ \n",
